On **May 28, 2024**, five generous donors visited **Tayzawbatha (Florida Buddhist Monastery)** to offer the daily meal (*dƒÅna*) to the resident monk.

Their visit was filled with joy, devotion, and wholesome merit as they gathered for blessings, Dhamma discussion, and fellowship.

The donor on the left is the original property donor of Pa-Auk Florida.
The donor next to Bhante Subhuti is the President of TVI
