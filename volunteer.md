### Role Overview

The volunteer serves as a *kappiya* or *yogi* helper to the monastic community.  
Typical responsibilities include:

- Offering breakfast food in the morning.  
- Reheating lunch when no donor is present.  
- Being present if a female visitor arrives without another companion.  
- Performing light maintenance or household chores depending on capability (such as mowing the lawn, cleaning, or simple repairs).  
- Other small tasks may be assigned as needed.

The role is intentionally simple so that the volunteer can keep time for personal practice and study.

### Opportunity for Merit

Supporting the comfort and well-being of monks, and helping to maintain an environment where the Vinaya can be fully observed, offers a rare opportunity to create great merit.  
As this monastery is now **reviving after a period of dormancy**, such support carries the same merit as helping to **establish or restore** a monastery.  

Moreover, living in a monastic environment allows you to make the highest kind of merit for yourself — the merit that arises through **virtue, mindfulness, and practice** — the foundation of true spiritual growth.


### How to Apply

Please write with a short self-introduction including:

- Meditation and monastic experience.  
- Motivation for volunteering.  
- Availability and preferred duration of stay.  
- Any practical skills (e.g., cooking, cleaning, gardening).  

Inquiries and applications should be sent through the **contact address listed on [americanmonk.org](https://americanmonk.org/about)**.

### Notes

This is a small, developing monastery rather than a large retreat center.  The emphasis is on simplicity, daily mindfulness, and a quiet environment supportive of the monastic life.

Thank you for your interest in supporting the Sangha through humble service.

With mettā,  
**The Sangha of Tayzawbatha Vihara**
