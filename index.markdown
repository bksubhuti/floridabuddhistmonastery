Tayzawbatha Vihara, Inc. is a non-profit 501c3 Buddhist monastery located in the peaceful rural community of Geneva, Florida. Founded to preserve and share the timeless teachings of the Buddha, the vihāra serves as a sanctuary for meditation, study, and spiritual growth. Our monastery is guided by dedicated bhikkhus, rooted in the Theravāda tradition.

The monastery provides a simple and serene environment, allowing visitors to step back from worldly distractions and cultivate the path of Dhamma. Over the years, Tayzawbatha Vihara has also hosted temporary novice monk ordinations—including Sayalay (nuns) who dedicate their lives to Buddhist practice. You can read more about these events and reflections on our ordination insights and time in Geneva.
