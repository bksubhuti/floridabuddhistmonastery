**Florida Buddhist Monastery (Tayzawbatha Vihara, Inc.)** is a Theravāda Buddhist monastery located in the peaceful rural community of Geneva, Florida—just northeast of Orlando, serving the Seminole County area.  It is legally registered and operated under **Tayzawbatha Vihara, Inc.**, a 501(c)(3) non-profit religious organization dedicated to preserving and sharing the timeless teachings of the Buddha.

The monastery serves as a sanctuary for meditation, study, and spiritual growth.  Our resident bhikkhus follow the traditional monastic discipline of Theravāda Buddhism and welcome lay visitors who wish to learn and practice the Dhamma.

The monastery provides a simple and serene environment, allowing visitors to step back from worldly distractions and cultivate the path of Dhamma.  Over the years, Tayzawbatha Vihara has also hosted temporary novice monk ordinations — including Sayalay (nuns) who dedicate their lives to Buddhist practice.
