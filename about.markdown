## 🧘‍♂️ Resident Monks

## Resident Monk Qualities
The resident monks are invited from the **orthodox Theravāda commentary vinaya tradition** — meaning they strictly follow the rules and guidelines laid out in the Pāḷi Theravāda root texts, commentaries, and sub-commentaries as practiced in the **Mahāvihāra**, **Pa-Auk** (Myanmar), or **Wat Khao Sanamchai** (Thailand) traditions.  They are also deeply committed to the **Abhidhamma** and the commentary explanations of the Buddha’s teachings.  

The monks are dedicated to preserving the Buddha’s teachings and sharing them with the community. These characteristics are what make **Tayzawbatha Vihara** unique among other Buddhist monasteries in the United States.  Although the monastery has roots in the Myanmar tradition, its vision is to welcome monks from any country who uphold these standards and can communicate in English.
