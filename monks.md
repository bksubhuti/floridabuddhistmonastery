### Resident Monks

- **Bhante Subhuti** — Resident Monk (January 10, 2026)
- **Bhante Indriasamvaro** — Visiting Monk (January 10, 2026)
- **Sayalay DhammaRatti** — Previous Temporary Nun

The resident monks are invited from the orthodox Theravāda commentary vinaya tradition.  That means strictly they follow the rules and guidelines laid out in the Pāḷi Theravāda root texts, commentaries and sub-commentaries as followed by the monasteries of Mahavihara or Pa-Auk in Myanmar or Wat Khao Sanamchai in Thailand. The monks are also committed to the Abhidhamma and the commentary explanations of the Buddha's teachings. 

The monks are dedicated to preserving the teachings of the Buddha and sharing them with the community. These characteristics, are what make Tayzawbatha Vihara unique among other Buddhist monasteries in the United States. Although this monastery has roots from a Myanmar tradition, the goal is have monks from any country that have the above qualities who can also speak in the English Language.
